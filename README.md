# Professional README Generator 
[![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)

## Description
This is a command-line application that creates professionally structured README.md files. The user must input a project title and description, as well as their GitHub username and email to be added to the 'Questions' section of the README file. Users also have the choice of including any of the following sections:
- Table of Contents
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Tests

The application takes a user's responses to the command-line prompts to use as content for the README file.
